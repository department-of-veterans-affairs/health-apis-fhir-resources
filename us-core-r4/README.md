# Release 4 (R4)

All models required to build R4 resources and datatypes are housed here.

Find more information about this specification [here](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/r4/).

All models supported by this library can be found [here](./src/main/java/gov/va/api/health/r4/api/resources).

### Within this module:
  * Java models for all R4 supported resources (below)
  * All common datatypes used in R4 resources
  * Tests for each Java model

Because validation logic is shared among all FHIR versions, it has been pulled out into its own [module](../validation).
