# Draft Standard for Trial Use v2 (DSTU2)

All models required to build DSTU2 resources and datatypes are housed here.

Find more information about this specification [here](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/dstu2/).

### Within this module:
  * Java models for all DSTU2 supported resources (below) 
  * All common datatypes used in DSTU2 resources
  * Tests for each Java model.

Because validation logic is shared among all FHIR versions, it has been pulled out into its own [module](../validation).

### Supported Resources:
  * [Appointment](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/dstu2/appointment.html#resource)
  * [Encounter](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/dstu2/encounter.html#resource)
  * [Location](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/dstu2/location.html#resource)
  * [Medication Dispense](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/dstu2/medicationdispense.html#resource)
  * [Organization](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/dstu2/organization.html#resource)
  * [Practitioner](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/dstu2/practitioner.html#resource)
