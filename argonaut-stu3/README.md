# Standard for Trial Use v3 (STU3)

All models required to build STU3 resources and datatypes are housed here.

Find more information about this specification [here](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/stu3/).

### Within this module:
  * Java models for all STU3 supported resources (below)
  * All common datatypes used in STU3 resources
  * Tests for each Java model.

Because validation logic is shared among all FHIR versions, it has been pulled out into its own [module](../validation).

### Supported Resources:
  * [Location](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/stu3/location.html#resource)
  * [Practitioner](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/stu3/practitioner.html#resource)
  * [PractitionerRole](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/stu3/practitionerrole.html#resource)
  * [Endpoint](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/stu3/endpoint.html#resource)
  * [Organization](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/stu3/organization.html#resource)
