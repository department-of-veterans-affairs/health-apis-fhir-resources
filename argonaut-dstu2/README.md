# Draft Standard for Trial Use v2 (DSTU2)

All models required to build DSTU2 resources and datatypes are housed here.

Find more information about this specification [here](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/dstu2/).

All models supported by this library can be found [here](./src/main/java/gov/va/api/health/dstu2/api/resources).

### Within this module:
  * Java models for all DSTU2 supported resources (below) 
  * All common datatypes used in DSTU2 resources
  * Tests for each Java model.

Because validation logic is shared among all FHIR versions, it has been pulled out into its own [module](../validation).
